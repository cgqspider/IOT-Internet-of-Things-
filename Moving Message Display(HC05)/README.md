# Introduction
This is a simple moving message display which can change its data from HC05. We can change its data at runtime. To do so we used HC05 and arduino nano as a controller. This project is specially designed for University purpose. So i can consider it as a Real time working Project.<br />
This has 2 version: <br />
1. Simple version (Simple_MMD). <br />
2. MMD with EEPROM  (MMD_EEPROM). <br />
