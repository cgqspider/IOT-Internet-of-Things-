<h1>Introduction</h1>
This is 3 step process for implementing the IOT and machine learning together. This was my dream project but i made soon with the help of IOT MONK. Thanks for helping me. Even I can modify this project to very higher extent but this is my first project with Machine Learning and Internet of things.

* Part 1: Using app scripts to Ssend the data to spreadsheet.<br>
 * Part 2 : Connecting Nodemcu to the Spread sheet for data sending to the cloud.<br>
* Part 3: Use that data to Train machine learning using random forest algorithm.<br />
